UCLA EPI 207: Reproducibility in EPI Research
This is assignment 3 where I was tasked with reproducing results from another groups research paper. There paper focused on evaluating the association between high levels of self-reported social cohesion variables and reporting a mental health burden (personal or members of their household) among California adults who report experiencing an extreme weather event in 2021.

I was able to reproduce their results from table 1 but had some issues with reproducing their table 2 results, primarily due to them switching reference levels and not stating it in the paper. I have provided my code in SAS for your view.
