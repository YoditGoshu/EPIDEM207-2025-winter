Association between Restlessness and Increased risk of Marijuana use in California adults

Project description: 
This was a group project that I completed for my Reproducibility in Epi Research class. My group member and I used CHIS 2020 data to assess whether experiencing restlessness in the past 30 days 
increased the risk of marijuana use among California adults, who do have a prior history of marijuana use within the past month. 


What makes your project stand out?
There is plenty of research completed on the role that other psychological stressors play on risk of marijuana use; however, few have looked the association between experiencing restlessness
and risk of marijuana use within the California population. Restlessness consists of feeling uneasy or inability to concentrate and/or relax, which we hypothesize may lead to individuals 
having a higher risk of marijuana use. 


Acknowledgments
I want to acknowledge my group member for being a great collaborator on this project.
